## QualityWatcher Reporter

> This project uses QualityWatcher WebdriverIO [reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qualitywatcher/wdio-reporter), and [service](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qualitywatcher/wdio-service)

When sending results to QualityWatcher, you will only need an API Key and an Email:

- QUALITYWATCHER_API_KEY=
- QUALITYWATCHER_EMAIL=

These should be placed in your `.env` file.

If you need more information on how to map test cases to existing qualitywatcher cases, please see [documentation](https://www.docs.qualitywatcher.com/docs/guides/integrating-automation-results)
