        content2: 'If other people are around, choose one person, look them in the eye, and tell them to call 911. If no one else is around, call yourself, using speakerphone setting, if available, to enable you to continue working at the scene.',
        title3: 'Step 3: Triage',
        content3: 'Group casualties by severity. Those that are mobile should group together and move from the scene to more clearly reveal the remaining casualties. Anyone who can scream has a clear airway and circulation. Those silent and not moving should be the priority. Those with obviously fatal injuries, like decapitation, should be disregarded until others have been helped to survive.',
        title4: 'Step 4: Provide care while waiting',
        content4: 'While awaiting Emergency Medical Services and First Responders to arrive, use the triage organization from the previous step to provide the most effective care you can. The goal is maximizing the number of survivors of the incident.',
        title5: 'Step 5: Transition of care',
        content5: 'Once EMS and / or First Responders arrive on scene, follow their directions fully and quickly. When prompted, give a concise report of the scene and what care you have provided. Keep it short, but remain available, or give contact information, so that the Scene Commander can get the details when it is the appropriate time. Be sure to go over the whole story in your own memory, to facilitate a precise and concise retelling, when needed.'
